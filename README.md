# YouTube Crawler Bot
This bot's purpose is to crawl YouTube and provide the details of the videos which it watches.

The point of this is to collect data on YouTube's recommendations for a new user and analyze that data.

This project was inspired by a YouTube video which I saw titled something like "how many YouTube videos until you get recommended an alt-right video?"

I felt that the video had some issues in its method, so I decided I would perform the same experiment myself.
